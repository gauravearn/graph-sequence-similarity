# estimating_the_graph_sequence_similarity
a site specific function to estimate the site similarity across the graphs to make it faster, i implemented a linear approach so that it will compare the iterable as a list and then stores it in the another iterable. You can nest these functions as callables under the class. Since graphs are nested as the linear in the grammar of the graphics, so it specifically reads the fasta as a linear fasta file and not multi line fasta.
